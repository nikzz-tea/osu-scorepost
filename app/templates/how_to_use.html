        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>
            This is osu!scorepost, the quickest and easiest way to generate a scorepost for sharing on r/osugame and becoming a part of osu! history!
        </p>
        <p>   
            A scorepost includes a post title and an image that replicates a screenshot of the osu! results screen. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <img class="example_scorepost" src="./static/example.gif" alt="example scorepost">
        <p>
            This scorepost was generated with just a score link, <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1777987420">https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1777987420</a>, and a single click!
        </p>

        <h3>Here are three ways to generate a scorepost:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Using a Score Link:</b></p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, simply enter a score link to generate a scorepost. 
                    Even links in the "old ID" format work (e.g., <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4100884541">https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4100884541</a>).
                    Just make sure the full link is entered correctly, without omitting "osu.ppy.sh."
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Using a User Profile Link:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Entering the link to a user's profile will generate a scorepost of that user's most recent score (even if it's a failed attempt!). You can also specify the game mode by using links that include the game mode in the URL (e.g., 
                     <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101/taiko">https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101/taiko</a>).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Using a Username:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Simply entering a username will generate a scorepost of that user's most recent score! This method will only work for the user's default game mode.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Auto Mode:</h3>
            <p>
                On the top right of the screenshot image, there is an option to toggle "Auto Mode". When Auto Mode is on, the app will copy your screenshot to your clipboard,
                and open Reddit in a new tab with your generated scorepost title already written in! All you would have to do is set the flair to "Gameplay," paste (CTRL/CMD + V)
                the screenshot, and click post!

        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, scores that are not the user's best on the map will not display the Geki and Katu counts.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Geki and Katu counts for Taiko scores are not available yet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                Differentiating between S-Ranks with sliderbreaks and FC's with some sliderend drops is not perfect. This is because the osu! 
                API does not differientiate between the 2 scenarios. The current temporary solution is that a score that has a 0 miss count and a max combo of more than or equal to 
                20 less than the beatmap's max combo is counted as an FC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                TLDR: A score is counted as an FC if score max combo >= beatmap max combo - 20
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Screenshot generator can only use the beatmapset background instead of beatmap background.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The generated screenshot is not draggable
                </p>
