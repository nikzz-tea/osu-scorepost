            This is osu!scorepost, the easiest way to quickly generate a scorepost to be posted on r/osugame and be apart of osu! history!
        </p>
        <p>
            A scorepost would consist of a title for your post and an image that replicates
            a screenshot on the osu! results screen. Example:
        </p>
        <h4>9MlCE | VINXIS - Sidetracked Day [Infinity Inside] +HDDT (DendyHere, 10.50*) 96.69% FC #1 | 1711pp</h1>

        <p>
            This scorepost was generate with just a score link <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1777987420">https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1777987420</a> and a click of a button!

        <h3>There are 3 ways to generate a scorepost:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Link of a score</b></p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, simply entering a link of a score would generate a scorepost. 
                    Even links in the "old id" format works. (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4100884541">https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4100884541</a>)
                    Please be sure that the full link is entered properly without leaving "osu.ppy.sh".
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Link of a user</b></p>
                <p>
                    Entering the link of a user's profile would create a scorepost of the user's most recent score. (even if it is counted as a fail!) You can also specify the gamemode by using 
                    the links that includes the gamemode (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101/taiko">https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101/taiko</a>)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Username</b></p>
                <p>
                    Just entering a username will also create a scorepost of the user's most recent score! Just by entering the username will only work for the user's default gamemode.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>After scorepost is created</h3>
        <p>
            After the scorepost have been successfully generated with the scorepost title, you can copy the title onto your clipboard 
            by clicking the clipboard icon right beside the scorepost title. 
        </p>
        <img class="tutorial_clipboard"src="/static/tutorial_clipboard.jpg">
        <p>
            If your screenshot was created, you can click the Reddit logo in the navigation bar to open the r/osugame submit page 
            in a new tab and drag the created screenshot into the image dropfield.
        </p>
        <img class="tutorial_reddit" src="/static/tutorial_reddit.jpg">
        <p>
            Paste your copied scorepost title into the post title field in Reddit, 
            set the flair to "Gameplay" and click Post!

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                Unfortunately, scores that are not the user's best score on the map will not display geki and katu count.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                Differentiating between S-Ranks with sliderbreaks and FC's with some sliderend drops is not perfect. This is because the osu! 
                API does not differientiate between the 2 scenarios. The current temporary solution is that a score that has a 0 miss count and a max combo of more than or equal to 
                20 less than the beatmap's max combo is counted as an FC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                TLDR: A score is counted as an FC if score max combo >= beatmap max combo - 20
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
